Greetings!

I'm one of the Technical Account Managers at Bitbar, based in California. I decided to create these repositories to help my customers make the most out of Bitbar technologies and to support product evaluations. The purpose of these guides is to supplement the Bitbar website and docs. If anything conflicts with official documentation (http://docs.bitbar.com/), please refer to those documents as the primary resource.

Best Regards,

Michael
